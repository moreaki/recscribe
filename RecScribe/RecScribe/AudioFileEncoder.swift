//  AudioFileEncoder.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  The codec seam (BL-011): turns a stream of captured PCM buffers into an
//  on-disk audio file in one format. Distinct from `AudioFileWriting`, which is
//  the higher-level workflow seam owned by `RecordingController`. An encoder is
//  owned privately by `AudioRecorder` and driven entirely on its serial
//  `processingQueue` — so it is intentionally NOT @MainActor and NOT Sendable;
//  the owner guarantees single-threaded, serial access.
//
//  Lifecycle is strict: createFile → writeBuffer* → finalize.
