//
//  AudioFormatNormalizer.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  Forces every captured buffer to one canonical format before it reaches an
//  encoder (BL-112).
//
//  Why this exists: `AudioRecorder` tells each encoder the file is 48 kHz stereo
//  (`AudioRecorder.startRecording`), and that has been true only because
//  `ScreenCaptureAudioManager` pins `config.sampleRate`/`channelCount` on the
//  `.audio` output. Those settings do **not** govern the `.microphone` output —
//  the SDK states a mic buffer's format follows the *device's* native format
//  (`SCStream.h`). A 44.1 kHz or mono mic would therefore reach an encoder that
//  has already written a 48 kHz stereo header, with no error anywhere:
//
//    · WAV  — the header stamps the declared rate/channels while the interleave
//             loop uses the buffer's, so a mono take plays at half speed an
//             octave down, and a 44.1 kHz take plays ~8.8% fast.
//    · M4A  — a mono buffer is appended to a 2-channel input; the append fails,
//             and `finalize()` then throws `.writeFailed`. The whole take is lost
//             at stop, not merely mistimed.
//    · FLAC — already refuses, via its own `processingFormat` guard (BL-013).
//
//  ⚠️ Threading: `AVAudioConverter` is declared Sendable but carries mutable
//  resampler state, so the compiler will not warn about cross-queue use. One
//  normalizer belongs to exactly one sample-handler queue, for its lifetime.
//  `.audio` and `.microphone` must therefore either share a queue or hold
//  separate normalizers — never one normalizer across two queues.
//
//  Not here: BL-130's Force Mono. Averaging L+R back into *both* channels is not
//  `AVAudioConverter.downmix` (which converts N→1 and would change the channel
//  count); it needs a separate transform on the already-canonical buffer. It
//  belongs downstream of this type, not inside it.
