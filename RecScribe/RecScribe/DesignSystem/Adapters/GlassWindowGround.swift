//  GlassWindowGround.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  The app's ground: real glass over the desktop. One view, used by every
//  surface, because the alternative was tried and it showed.
//
//  The popover, the sheets and the floating panel originally took a flat
//  opaque fill instead, on the reasoning that a popover already draws its own
//  vibrancy and a second material stacked on it would read as mud. The
//  reasoning was sound and the result was still wrong: an opaque fill *covers*
//  the host's vibrancy rather than adding to it, so those surfaces came out
//  visibly darker than the window they belong to. Consistency here is not a
//  matter of taste — two panels of the same app in the same glance should be
//  made of the same material.
//
//  Two AppKit facts shape the implementation, because SwiftUI has no lever for
//  either:
//
//  1. SwiftUI's `Material` blends *within* the window — it blurs in-window
//     content behind the view. A ground has nothing in-window behind it, so a
//     SwiftUI material resolves to flat grey no matter how transparent the
//     window is: the "frosted panel over flat black is just a grey rectangle"
//     case, wearing a different hat. Glass that samples the *desktop* is
//     `NSVisualEffectView` with `.behindWindow` blending, and nothing else.
//
//  2. A window only lets that blur through if it stops painting its own
//     background (`isOpaque = false`, clear `backgroundColor`). That is true of
//     the main window, the panel, the sheets and the popover alike, which is
//     why the configurator below applies to all of them and asks the window
//     what it is rather than being told.

            // window; a behind-window effect view samples the desktop and
            // ignores in-window layers entirely, so the only place a tint can
