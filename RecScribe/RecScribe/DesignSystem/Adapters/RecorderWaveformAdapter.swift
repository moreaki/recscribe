//  Turns what the recorder publishes into what the bar renderer wants.
//
//  The recorder publishes ~200 *signed* samples for a polyline that drew the
//  signal above and below a centre line. The bar renderer wants *unsigned*
//  0…1 magnitudes. Converting here, at the view boundary, is what keeps a purely
//  visual change out of the audio path: neither WaveformDownsampler nor
//  RecorderViewModel learns that a renderer changed, so their tests keep holding
//  the contracts they were written to hold.
