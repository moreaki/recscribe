//
//  SettingsPopover.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  The settings shelf's two pop-up menus, rebuilt as one popover.
//
//  The design system deliberately ships no picker component — a settings layout
//  is a product decision, not a design-system one — so this is composed from its
//  primitives: an eyebrow per section, chips for a choice among knowns, nav links
//  for a command.
//
//  The two controls differ on purpose. Format is a *choice* among three short,
//  fixed options, so the chips show the alternatives as well as the current
//  value: picking one is a single click, where the old menu took two, and the
//  fact that other formats exist is visible at rest. Save location is a
//  *command* — it opens a system file picker — so it stays a link.
//
//  Visibility is unchanged: the caller still gates this on `showsSettingsShelf`,
//  so the whole control disappears for the length of a take exactly as the shelf
//  did. Settings are captured at start and cannot change until it ends, and
//  hiding the control says that more plainly than disabling it would.
//
