//
//  FLACEncoder.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  FLAC conformer of AudioFileEncoder (BL-013). Lossless, ~0.23–0.7× the size
//  of the equivalent WAV depending on content.
//
//  Like every encoder it runs entirely on AudioRecorder's serial processingQueue,
//  so it is not thread-safe by design — the owner guarantees serial access.
//
//  ⚠️ Route note (BL-013 spike, 2026-07-29): `AVAssetWriter` CANNOT write FLAC.
//  It raises an *uncatchable* Objective-C NSException for any FLAC UTI — not a
//  Swift error, so it cannot be caught or recovered from — and there is no
//  `AVFileType.flac` in the SDK at all. `AVAudioFile` + `kAudioFormatFLAC` is the
//  only working route. Do not "fix" this back to AVAssetWriter.
