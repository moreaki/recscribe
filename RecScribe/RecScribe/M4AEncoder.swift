//
//  M4AEncoder.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  AAC-in-M4A conformer of AudioFileEncoder (BL-012). Encodes the captured
//  Float32 PCM stream to AAC via AVAssetWriter (44.1kHz, 256 kbps, stereo).
//
//  Like every encoder it runs entirely on AudioRecorder's serial processingQueue,
//  so it is not thread-safe by design — the owner guarantees serial access.
//
//  Impedance mismatch handled here: our contract is a *synchronous push*
//  (writeBuffer per buffer), while AVAssetWriterInput is push-but-async
//  (append only when `isReadyForMoreMediaData`, and `finishWriting` is async).
//  A small pending queue absorbs the rare not-ready window; finalize() drains it
//  and bridges the async finish to the synchronous contract via a semaphore.
