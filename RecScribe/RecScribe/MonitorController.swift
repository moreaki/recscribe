//
//  MonitorController.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  Live headphone monitoring of the selected input device (BL-131).
//
//  Fully independent of the recording pipeline: its own `AVAudioEngine`, its own
//  lifecycle, its own failure handling. Monitoring is a convenience; a recording
//  is not. **A monitor failure must never move `RecordingState` to `.error`** —
//  that is the load-bearing invariant of this file, and the one thing here that
//  is unit-testable without hardware.
//
//  ⚠️ Not shipped until the concurrency spike passes. Six of BL-131's nine
//  acceptance criteria need a human with headphones: whether an SCK `.microphone`
//  capture and an `AVAudioEngine` reading the *same* device glitch against each
//  other, and the clap-test latency measurement. What is settled statically is
//  that nothing *forbids* it — measured `kAudioDevicePropertyHogMode == -1` (free)
//  on both devices, so neither client takes exclusive access. The spike is about
//  quality, not feasibility.
