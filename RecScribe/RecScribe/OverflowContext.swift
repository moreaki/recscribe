//  OverflowContext.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  The immutable snapshot `OverflowMenu.entries(_:)` builds from (BL-111).
//
//  The menu is rebuilt from scratch every time it opens, so every piece of
//  visible state — which source is checked, whether the section is shown at all —
//  is *derived* from this struct rather than stored anywhere. Desync between the
//  menu and the real selection is therefore unrepresentable, not merely avoided.
