//
//  OverflowMenu.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  The menu-bar overflow menu (BL-110). Secondary actions live here instead of
//  as flat buttons in the popover, which keeps the popover free for the primary
//  record/waveform surface as more features land.
//
//  Two surfaces present this menu — the "•••" button in the popover and a
//  right-click on the status item — so `entries` is the single definition both
//  render from. Adding a row in one place adds it to both.
//

// MARK: - The popover's "•••" affordance

/// Pops the same `NSMenu` the status item's right-click does.
///
/// ⚠️ This deliberately is **not** a SwiftUI `Menu`. SwiftUI evaluates a
/// `Menu`'s content ViewBuilder **eagerly** — measured: the closure body runs
/// with zero clicks, before the menu is ever opened — and offers no supported
/// open hook. A capture-source picker built inside one would therefore call
/// `SCShareableContent` on *popover appearance*: a zero-click permission dialog,
/// the exact bug class BL-085 removed. A plain `Button` that builds the menu in
/// its action keeps enumeration behind a real click.
