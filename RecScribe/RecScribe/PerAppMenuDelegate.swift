//  PerAppMenuDelegate.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  Populates the Per-App submenu on open, without ever blocking (BL-111).
//
//  Two hazards shape this file, and both are measured rather than theorised:
//
//  1. **Enumerating apps costs a permission prompt.** `SCShareableContent`
//     bypasses `PermissionProviding`, can raise the system dialog, and registers
//     the app with TCC. So it runs only behind a deliberate submenu open, and
//     only when permission is already granted. A plain right-click on the status
//     item — which never opens this submenu — does zero enumeration.
//
//  2. **`menuNeedsUpdate` is synchronous, on the main thread, inside AppKit's
//     menu-tracking loop.** Bridging the `async` enumeration with a semaphore is
//     a *guaranteed deadlock*, not a slow menu: the `Task { @MainActor }` is
//     enqueued on the main actor's executor while `wait()` blocks the very
//     thread that would drain it. Measured: it never completes. The only correct
//     shape is return-immediately-from-cache, then refresh out of band.
//

import AppKit

/// In-memory list of running apps, shared between menu opens.

/// Deliberately holds *only* the probe result. Display names live on
/// `AudioSourceManager`, which persists them — a second copy here would be the
/// same fact in two stores, diverging the moment one is updated and the other
/// isn't, and would be lost on relaunch besides.
///
/// Deliberately a reference type held by `MenuBarController`: the menu is rebuilt
/// per open, so a cache owned by the menu would be cold every single time and the
/// first open would always show a placeholder.
