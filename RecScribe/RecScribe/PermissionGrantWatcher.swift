//  PermissionGrantWatcher.swift
//  RecScribe
//
//  Watches for a permission grant made in System Settings while the app is
//  running (BL-088). This is the retry mechanism the guide panel used to bundle
//  with its UI: a single probe on returning to the app can race the TCC write —
//  observed live, 2026-07-28: grant via the Settings toggle with no poll running
//  left the app stuck at "Almost ready" until relaunch, while the identical flow
//  with a poll caught the grant within a second. The UI was redundant; this loop
//  is not.
//
//  BL-085-compliant for the same reason the panel's loop was: it only ever
//  starts behind the user's own click ("Open System Settings" / Record).
