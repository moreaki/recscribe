//  Which system permission is being requested, and everything the user needs to
//  find it in System Settings (BL-081).
//
//  The navigation copy lives here rather than in a view because it changes as a
//  *unit* — the pane heading, the confusable neighbour, and the deep-link anchor
//  are three facets of one fact, and they move together. When Apple renames a
//  pane, or when BL-101 moves system-audio capture to the audio-only permission,
//  this file is the whole diff.
