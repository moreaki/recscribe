            //
            // The mesh exists so that a frosted panel has tonal variation to
            // sample — over flat black, a translucent panel is just a grey
            // rectangle. This window has no panel: it is one centred column
            // straight on the window background. With nothing sampling it, the
            // mesh stops reading as depth and starts reading as blue wallpaper,
            // which is a lot of colour for a window whose job is to stay out of
            // the way. If the layout ever grows a real glass panel, the mesh
            // earns its place and `GlassBackdrop()` goes back here.
            //
            // The ground is a sibling of RecorderView rather than a modifier on
            // it, and that placement is load-bearing. RecorderViewModel is an
            // ObservableObject, so publishing a waveform frame invalidates every
            // view that reads it — the whole of RecorderView's body, roughly 47
            // times a second while recording. Out here the ground reads the theme
            // and nothing else, so it stays out of that.

                .environmentObject(viewModel)

                }
                // `.background` rather than a ZStack sibling, and the distinction
                // is load-bearing twice over. A background is sized *by* its
                // content and never the other way round, so the window keeps the
                // fixed 450×450 that `.windowResizability(.contentSize)` depends
                // on — as a ZStack sibling the ground is a Color, which is
                // infinitely flexible, and the window becomes freely resizable
                // with the controls stranded in the middle of it. It also still
                // sits outside RecorderView's body, so the ~47×/sec waveform
                // republish never drags the ground through a redraw.

        // No titlebar band: the glass runs to the window's top edge and the
        // traffic lights float on it. This is SwiftUI's own lever — the AppKit
        // route (`titlebarAppearsTransparent` + `.fullSizeContentView`) gets
        // reasserted from under us on scene updates, so the band kept coming
        // back. The title *text* goes with it; the app's name is carried by the
        // brand lockup in the header, which is where the Glass concept puts it.
