//  BL-156: deadline-bounded waits for tests that must let another task make
//  progress before asserting.
//
//  These replace `for _ in 0..<2000 where condition { await Task.yield() }`,
//  which was the shape used at 45 sites across seven files and which fails in
//  two ways at once.
//
//  It measures the wrong quantity. These suites are `@MainActor` and Swift
//  Testing runs suites in parallel, so every yield re-enqueues the test behind
//  whatever else is contending for the actor. How many yields it takes for the
//  task under test to reach its third poll is a function of machine load, not
//  of the work being tested — so the budget that is ample on an idle laptop is
//  not ample on a loaded CI runner.
//
//  And it fails silently. The loop exits when the budget runs out exactly as it
//  exits on success, so the *following* `#expect` reports a logic failure for
//  what was a scheduling timeout. That is how commit 66d0702 — three added
//  lines of CHANGELOG.md, no source change — turned CI red on
//  `backgroundGrantIsDetectedWithoutInteraction`, and took the Release-build
//  gate down with it, since the job is sequential.
//
//  Bounding by wall-clock time instead means a loaded runner takes longer and
//  still passes, and a genuine hang is reported as the timeout it is.
//
