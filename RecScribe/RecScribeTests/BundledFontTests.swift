//  This guards a failure that is otherwise completely silent. Fonts are
//  registered at runtime from the app bundle, and both the app's own views and
//  the design system look them up by name — the design system through
//  `NSFont(name:)`, whose result it caches for the process lifetime. A miss
//  throws nothing and logs nothing: SwiftUI simply falls back to the system font
//  at the same size, so the app stays correctly proportioned and quietly wears
//  the wrong face.
//
//  It is also not a hypothetical mismatch. `Inter.ttf` carries the PostScript
//  name "Inter-Regular" but the family name "Inter", and `Archivo-Variable.ttf`
//  reports the family "Archivo SemiBold" with "Archivo" only as its typographic
//  family. The two name tables are genuinely different shapes, and the lookups
//  depend on which one resolution finds.
