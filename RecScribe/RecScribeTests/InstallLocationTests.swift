//  BL-082: bundle-location classification and the two-tier consequence — a hard
//  block for translocation, at most a dismissible note for anything else.
//
//  `classify(_:)` is a pure function of a path, so every branch is covered here
//  with no mocks, no hardware, no permission, and no sleeps. What is *not*
//  covered, and cannot be: real Gatekeeper translocation (needs a quarantined
//  bundle on a mounted disk image), the Finder reveal, and whether a grant
//  actually survives a relaunch. Those are manual, and best run on a non-admin
//  account where the interesting failures live.
