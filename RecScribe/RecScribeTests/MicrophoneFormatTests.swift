//
//  BL-150: `AudioSampleConverter.makePCMBuffer` dropped every buffer a
//  microphone delivered in an integer PCM format, and the caller discarded it
//  without logging — so a recording finished as a header with no audio and the
//  only symptom was "No audio was captured for this recording".
//
//  Found by manual acceptance, not by this suite, and the reason is worth
//  keeping: `SampleBufferFixtures` could only build **Float32** buffers, so
//  every test fed the converter exactly the format it already assumed. The
//  fixtures encoded the same belief as the code, which made them incapable of
//  failing on it. 282 tests green, feature broken.
//
//  Measured from the hardware (Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen):
//
//      4ch 48000Hz 24-bit int alignedHigh container=4B flags=20
//
//  ⚠️ The general hazard, from the `audio-pipeline` skill: the SCK config's
//  `sampleRate`/`channelCount` govern the `.audio` output ONLY. A `.microphone`
//  buffer arrives in the device's native format. System-audio capture works
//  because SCK pins it to Float32; microphone capture worked only on devices
//  that happened to send Float32 — and this interface offers no Float32 format
//  at any sample rate.
