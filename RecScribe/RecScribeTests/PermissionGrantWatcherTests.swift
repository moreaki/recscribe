//  BL-088: the grant watcher's loop lifetime and budget, plus the view-model
//  probe races it inherits from BL-081. The watcher is the retry mechanism that
//  used to live behind the guide panel: a single probe on returning to the app
//  can race the TCC write, and without the loop a missed race strands the app
//  at "Almost ready" until relaunch — observed live, 2026-07-28.
//
//  The permission *copy* tests survive from BL-081 — the navigation hint is
//  still the feature, it just lives only in the main window and popover now.
