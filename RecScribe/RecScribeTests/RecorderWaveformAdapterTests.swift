//  The signed-to-magnitude conversion behind the bar renderer.

//  This is the only new logic the design-system migration introduced — everything
//  else is styling, which no unit test can judge. So it is worth testing
//  properly: it sits between an audio path that is frozen by its own tests and a
//  renderer that is vendored, and it is the one place a visual change could
